## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to display examples of various design patterns as developed for Java.
The examples are developed with guidance from the APRESS book: Java Design Patterns. As
more patterns are experimented with and examples made, other books may be
incorporated as well as personal experience. Commentary on the patterns will
be found in README's found in the modules themselves.
